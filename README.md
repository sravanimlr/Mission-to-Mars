# Mission-to-Mars
Creating a webpage that uses real-time data scraping to load files and images.

## Project Overview 
A Mar's Webpage was created with the help of datascraping tools such as BeautifulSoup. The webpage was linked to a Mongo Database to ensure that all information was stored properly. Finally, a few more components such as 4 hemispheres and their images were added to increase the depth of the webpage. The project focused heavily on HTML formatting and using the Flask app to create the appropriate routes.
